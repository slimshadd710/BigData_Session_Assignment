1 )Pig uses MapReduce to execute all of its data processing. It compiles the Pig Latin scripts
that users write into a series of one or more MapReduce jobs that it then executes.

2)
Pig is application that runs on top of MapReduce and abstracts Java MapReduce jobs away from developers.
Pig Latin uses a lot fewer lines of code than the Java MapReduce script.
The Pig Latin script was is easier to read for someone without a Java background.
MapReduce jobs can written in Pig Latin.
Java is a great and powerful language, but it has a higher learning curve than something like Pig Latin. Therefore, using a higher-level language, like Pig Latin, enables many more developers/analysts to write MapReduce jobs.

3)

It's acts as Interpretor between Pig Latin script and Mapreduce Jobs .Its creating environment to execute Pig scripts into series of mapreduce jobs in parllel manner .

4) 

Local Mode

5) 
The Grunt shell of Apache Pig is mainly used to write Pig Latin scripts.

6)
Pig Latin is declarative, SQL-like language; the high level language interface for Hadoop.

7)
The names (aliases) of relations and fields are case sensitive. The names of Pig Latin functions are case sensitive. The names of parameters (see Parameter Substitution) and all other Pig Latin keywords are case insensitive.


8) 
In computer programming, dataflow programming is a programming paradigm that models a program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing dataflow principles and architecture.
